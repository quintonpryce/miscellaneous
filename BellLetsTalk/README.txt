Bell Let’s Talk - 1/23/2017

______________________________________________________________________________

This is the first time this has been run but I plan on fixing the mistakes I find from this year, and I hope many people are able to raise some money this year! 

Please let me know how it went and how much money you raised, you can email me at quinton138@live.com.

Each twitter account you run it on should have the capability of raising $50 (that’s 1000 tweets).

Windows Instructions
1) Go to the ‘Windows’ file and open the ‘dist’ file folder
2) Double click the letsTalkWin.exe
3) Wait for the Chrome Page to open and ask for your twitter login credentials
  (Somepoint during this process it may ask you for access through your firewall, just accept)
4) Watch as the program tweets out #BellLetsTalk

*If the program crashes, just close it down and re-open it. There is a limit on how many tweets you can make per day and per half hour, so twitter may restrict you from making more tweets. The program will remember where you are and continue where you left off.
